    "##### Case Study: SONAR — Detecting Mines vs. Rocks\n",
    "##### 1️. Business Objective\n",
    "###### Goal:\n",
    "###### To build an intelligent system that can automatically detect whether an underwater sonar signal is reflected from a metallic mine (potentially dangerous) or a harmless rock.\n",
    "##### This is vital for:\n",
    "###### Maritime safety: Prevent ships and submarines from colliding with mines.\n",
    "###### Naval defense: Identify and safely remove underwater mines.\n",
    "###### Resource exploration: Distinguish between useful metal structures and natural seabed objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2.Problem Statement\n",
    "###### In underwater environments, sonar (sound navigation and ranging) is used to detect objects. However, raw sonar signals can be noisy and difficult for humans to interpret consistently.\n",
    "##### This dataset:\n",
    "###### Contains 208 sonar returns.\n",
    "###### o111 are from metal cylinders (mines).\n",
    "###### o97 are from rocks.\n",
    "###### Each sonar return is represented by 60 numeric features, each measuring the energy of the signal in a frequency band.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The problem:\n",
    "###### To train a Deep learning model that can learn the difference in signal patterns and classify new sonar signals as either Mine (M) or Rock (R) — accurately and reliably.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Dataset: \"sonardataset.csv\"\n",
    "###### Features (Inputs)\n",
    "###### There are 60 numerical variables, each representing the energy in a specific frequency band of the sonar signal.\n",
    "###### In the original dataset, they’re just unnamed columns V1, V2, ..., V60 — you can keep it clear and simple:\n",
    "##### Target (Output)\n",
    "###### The label is a single categorical variable indicating:\n",
    "###### o\"M\" for Mine\n",
    "###### o\"R\" for Rock\n",
    "================================================================================\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Tasks\n",
    "##### 1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing\n",
    "###### ●Begin by loading and exploring the \"Alphabets_data.csv\" dataset. Summarize its key features such as the number of samples, features, and classes.\n",
    "###### ●Execute necessary data preprocessing steps including data normalization, managing missing values.\n",
    "##### 2. Model Implementation\n",
    "###### ●Construct a basic ANN model using your chosen high-level neural network library. Ensure your model includes at least one hidden layer.\n",
    "###### ●Divide the dataset into training and test sets.\n",
    "###### ●Train your model on the training set and then use it to make predictions on the test set.\n",
    "##### 3. Hyperparameter Tuning\n",
    "###### ●Modify various hyperparameters, such as the number of hidden layers, neurons per hidden layer, activation functions, and learning rate, to observe their impact on model performance.\n",
    "###### ●Adopt a structured approach like grid search or random search for hyperparameter tuning, documenting your methodology thoroughly.\n",
    "##### 4. Evaluation\n",
    "###### ●Employ suitable metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate your model's performance.\n",
    "###### ●Discuss the performance differences between the model with default hyperparameters and the tuned model, emphasizing the effects of hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "##### Evaluation Criteria\n",
    "###### ●Accuracy and completeness of the implementation.\n",
    "###### ●Proficiency in data preprocessing and model development.\n",
    "###### ●Systematic approach and thoroughness in hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "###### ●Depth of evaluation and discussion.\n",
    "###### ●Overall quality of the report.\n",
    "##### Additional Resources\n",
    "###### ●TensorFlow Documentation\n",
    "###### ●Keras Documentation\n",
    "We wish you the best of luck with this assignment. Enjoy exploring the fascinating world of neural networks and the power of hyperparameter tuning!"
