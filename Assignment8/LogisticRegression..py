# ### 6. Deployment with Streamlit:
# * In this task, you will deploy your logistic regression model using Streamlit. The deployment can be done locally or online via Streamlit Share. Your task includes creating a Streamlit app in Python that involves loading your trained model and setting up user inputs for predictions.
